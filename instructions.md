> Timebox the activity to ~15minutes. If you don't get all the way through it call it a day and redo the kata tomorrow. Once you can complete all the excercise in ~5m you have mastered it and can return to refresh later down the road.
 
## Making a vanilla docker container
 - create a new network for saying hello
 - use ubuntu image on docker.io
 - create a process that prints hello and sleeps in between
 - run it as a daemon
 - name it 'hello_world'
 - register the container to the hello network
 - print the logs from the container
 - verify the container is in the correct network
 - stop the container
 - remove the container
